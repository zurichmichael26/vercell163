    <h3>The love that mother has for the daughter.</h3>
    <p>Ncert doesn&#039;t change course books much it seems. A poem i wrote for my mom as a gift.mother of mine, how much i love you, it&#039;s impossible to describe, impossible to do. How could i possibly thank you enough, the one who makes me whole, the one to whom i owe my life, the forming of my soul? Thanking my mother for piano lessons by diane wakoski a poem expressing gratitude for a simple part of childhood, as the poet remembers the 7.</p>
