                Dad was there for the family, through good times and bad, and will always be cherished. They fill you with the faults they had. It tells the story of how the narrator, looking at his own hands, remembers his dead father&#039;s hands.
    </p>

    <h3>My dad&#039;s hands, a poem by david ketter, seems to have been written in a time when children and their fathers were just learning how to begin to relate to each other.</h3>
