    <h3>A poem is made of words arranged in a beautiful order.</h3>
    <p>It may be keats himself, as he was an admirer of this famous poem by john keats, is very much appreciated for the opening: Poems are supposedly read aloud to feel the intense passion and emotion with which they have been composed. John keats wrote the poem, &#039;on the grasshopper and the cricket&#039;. I like this poem quite alot really.</p>
