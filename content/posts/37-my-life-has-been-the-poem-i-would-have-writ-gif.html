    <h3>Try to name this song its a country song correct answer gets brainly i wandered so aimless life filled with sin i wouldn&#039;t let my.</h3>
    <p>My life has been the poem i would have writ but i could not both live and utter it. Also worth noting is that life is not noted as having been a poem, which could have meant one of many. &#039;if events in my life had had a huge direct influence, i would have put them in. My life has been the poem i would have writ but i could not both live and utter it.</p>
