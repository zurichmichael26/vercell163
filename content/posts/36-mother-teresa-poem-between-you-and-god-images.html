                I&#039;ll try not to forget what i know i should do. Mother teresa told us to love one another. Who wrote mother teresa&#039;s poem?
    </p>

    <h3>And agnes&#039;s mother was good to them too.</h3>
    <p>Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. Mother teresa was one of the most gifted souls in recent history, piercing the darkness of this life to discover the unfathomable love god has for us. It was never between you and them anyway. She was born in a small village in albania and became one of the most famous women on earth.</p>
