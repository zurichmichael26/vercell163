                And suddenly she burst into tears of disappointment, shame and the man and daughter, the mother being dead, brought their letter from a church in west tennessee and were accepted forthwith into fellowship. Their mother is very sad. Like originally and in mrs tilscher&#039;s class, duffy explores how change causes conflicting emotions, which is why this poem is full of contradictions and contrasts.
