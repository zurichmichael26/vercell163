                Trees is a lyric poem by american poet joyce kilmer. This is how my autumn trees look already. The oak tree is one of the most loved trees in the world, and with good reason.
    </p>

    <h3>Choose a colour and underline the reason a tree was lost in ten tall oak trees standing in a line, warships, cried king henry, then there were nine.</h3>
    <p>Of me, days ago i was not sure, of how much force i could endure, but know i know i am so strong, and all beacsue of you, so now i give thanks, where thanks are due But i have roots stretched in the earth growing stronger since my birth you&#039;ll never touch them, for you see they are the deepest part of me. The oak tree is one of the most loved trees in the world, and with good reason. Nine tall oak trees growing strong and straight, charcoal.</p>
