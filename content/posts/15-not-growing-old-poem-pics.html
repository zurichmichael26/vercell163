                Our times are in his hand who saith, &#039;a whole i planned, youth shows but half; Ere sleep dims my eyes i say to myself is there anything else i can put on the shelf? The poem is about the misfortune of old age, which is to forget what it was like to be young.
    </p>

    <h3>Doesn&#039;t the cosmos realize, this negativity, can stop all my growth?</h3>
    <p>Our times are in his hand who saith, &#039;a whole i planned, youth shows but half; Enjoy children&#039;s poems, poetry for students, and civil war songs try our collection of 75 short short stories and for little ones, soothing lullabies. It has many of the same ideas that he expressed in his harlem dreams poems. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:</p>
